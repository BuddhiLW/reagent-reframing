ajax.interceptors\n  \"This file contains the standard interceptors used by cljs-ajax to implement\n   most of the 'magic'. There are four of them: \n     \n     * ProcessGet, which handles the fact that GETs do not have bodies and so need treating separately.\n     * ApplyRequestFormat, which takes the request format key and applies it to the params key.\n     * ResponseFormat, which is a parameterised interceptor dynamically added to the interceptor list. Note that the response format routines return one of these.\n     * DirectSubmission, which spots that you're using a type that doesn't need format processing and sends it immediately.\n   \n   There are no functions forming part of the public API in this file, so\n   unless you're working on, studying or debugging cljs-ajax, you're \n   probably in the wrong place.\"\n    (:require [clojure.string :as str]\n              [ajax.util :as u]\n              [ajax.url :as url]\n              [ajax.protocols :refer\n                  [-body -process-request -process-response -abort -status\n                   -get-response-header -status-text -js-ajax-request\n                   -was-aborted\n                   #?@ (:cljs [AjaxImpl AjaxRequest AjaxResponse\n                               Interceptor Response])]]\n              #?
